					"Contrast to tourists' image of Kyoto as the capital of traditional Japan, Kyoto Station's futuristic design and atmosphere attempts to convey historical Kyoto through modern aesthetics. This massive station has two sides. On the north side, the Karamsuma side leads downtown to many hotels, shops and Kyoto Tower. The southern Hachijo side is much calmer and leads to more bus stops as well as some temples. The station is a greate starting point, especially providing the general Tourist Information Center that offers multilingual staff and free internet access.",
					"Across from Kyoto Station, we have Kyoto Tower. This is Kyoto's tallest structure and is a modern iconic landmark of the city. Standing 100 meters above ground, tourists are allowed a 360 degree view of Kyoto even reaching Osaka if the skies allow.",
					"Commonly referred to as Kyoto's Kitchen, Nishiki Market is a narrow five block long shopping street and plentiful shops and restaurants. These shops have greate assortments of seafood, produce, and kitchenware, and is also a great place to find seasonal foods. The market is the perfect place to get that Kyoto feeling. Often shops welcome customers with samples of their dishes such as skewers. Make sure to refrain from eating while walking as it is deemed impolite.",
					"The Kyoto International Manga Museum is a manga reader's paradise. Although the manga mainly in Japanese, there is a small section of books dedicated to foreign and translated manga. The Manga Museum also features works of international manga as well and will often host manga related events that involve foreign artists.",
					"One of Koyoto's most atmospheric dinig areas, Pontocho is a narrow alley that runs a whole block west of the Kamogawa River. This wonderous place is filled with a variety of restaurants that include traditional and modern Kyoto cuisine to high class foreign cuisine. Exclusively from May to September, many platforms, known as kawayuka, are built over floating water where patrons are allowed to dine in the open air.",
					"The Philosopher's Path is a stone path that traverses the northern part of Kyoto that is lined with hundred of cherry trees. Early April is the best time to see these magnificent trees bloom altogether, making this location a hotpot for cherry blossom viewing. It is quite common to see a bunch of locals walk along this path as it was regularly used by traditional philosophers who are said to have used this route as a daily commute to Kyoto University.",
					"Kyoto's most popular park for cherry blossoms. During the first half of April upon the cherry trees' full bloom, many viewing parties are held. The centerpiece of the park is a tall weeping cherry tree which becomes lit up during the night time.",
					"Fushimi Inari Shrine is one of the more popular Shinto shrine in souther Kyoto. This shrine is one of many dedicated to Inary, the Shinto god of rice. While the primary reason to visit the shrine is its mountain trail that leads to an amazing view of Kyoto, the buildings themselves also serve as a major source of attraction. Along the path up the trail, torii gates line the way, and within the gates, an inscription can be seen of the donators of the gate. The trail may take a few hours, but along the way there are many restaurants and stops to enjoy the view.",
					"Within northern Kyoto lies what may be its best onsen. Kurama is a rural town in the northern mountains, which lies an hour from the city center. Its main attraction is the Buddhist temple, Kurama-dera, that is a half hour climb up the main buildingsm which can be accessed halfway by cablecar and walked by the other half. The hiking trail of the temple's main buildings leads through forests into other small valleys. Since onsens in Kyotos may be uncommon, take advantage of Kurama's relaxing open-air hotspring in a traditional ryokan."
