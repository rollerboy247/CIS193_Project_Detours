        "This is Kyoto's most popular park for cherry blossoms. During the first half of April upon the cherry trees' full bloom, many viewing parties are held. The centerpiece of the park is a tall weeping cherry tree which becomes lit up during the night time.",
        "Fushimi Inari Shrine is one of the more popular Shinto shrines in southern Kyoto. While the primary reason to visit the shrine is its mountain trail that leads to an amazing view of Kyoto, the buildings themselves also serve as a major source of attraction.",
        "Within northern Kyoto lies what may be its best onsen. Kurama is a rural town in the northern mountains, which lies an hour from the city center."
